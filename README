Description:
  This script will take a morning problem tar.gz file, extract it, reaname the
    folder within it, and prepend a custom header to the soln *.py file. If no
    initial .py file is provided it will create one and prepend the header. The
    script will then open the .py soln file within Atom (IDE). Now your ready!

Included Files:
  prep_mp.sh
  custom_mp_header.txt
  README

Setup Instructions:
  1.If necessary change the script_path var to wherever you place this file so
    it may be called within any directory path via 'bash prep_mp.sh ---'.
    As far as my beginner knowledge goes it seems most appropriate to place
    it in the /usr/local/bin directory.
  2.You must place the custom_mp_header.txt file in the same place as the script
    in order for this to work properly.
  3. Add your name to the custom_mp_header.txt file

Running Instructions:
  1. Call this script with the 3 required args, after typing 'bash' . You may
     be prompt to enter your password to run script as super user.
  2. Solve the morning problem without hassle of setting things up !

Arguments:
  1: path to the morning problem tar file
  2: path to extract the morning problem too
  3: corresponding morning problem number (chronological order)

Notes:
  -This script currently grabs the first tar file it sees in the specified
   dir! MAKE SURE there are no other tar files in that dir.
  -Do not add to/ change line 3 of the custom header as the script will
   automatically erase this line and replace it with a current date/time stamp!

IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
 -Get 'input/ouput text from pdf (auto make test cases for - if(name == "main")
 -Add script to user path so it doesnt need to be in current terminal dir
 -Use selenium or some visual webscraper to grab the tar file from eclass
   right when MDT (dont use sys time so people outside alberta can use this)
   time hits 10:10am
 -Add check to identify morning problem tar from other tars in same dir

Noob bash notes:
  -no spaces allowed around '=' when assigning variable a value
  -args are referenced in bash by $1, $2, $3...etc.  $# returns num of args
